Hello, I'm Oroni Hasan, known as Chhuti. Originally from Bangladesh, I now reside in Sweden. I attend Fäladsskolan and I'm currently in the fourth grade. My favorite color is purple, and I enjoy hobbies such as crafting and drawing. I'm also delving into coding. Additionally, my dad and I manage two websites—one focused on AI and the other on travel.

My blog will showcase pictures of me along with images of my crafting and programming projects. Additionally, it will feature videos highlighting various activities I'm involved in, such as Karate and Scouts.
