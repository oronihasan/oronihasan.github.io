Hello, I'm Oroni Hasan. Originally from Bangladesh, I now reside in Sweden. I attend Internationella Engelska Skolan, Lund and I'm currently in the sixth grade. My favorite color is purple and yellow.

My blog will showcase pictures of me along with images of my crafting and programming projects. Additionally, it will feature videos highlighting various activities I'm involved in, such as Karate and Scouts.
