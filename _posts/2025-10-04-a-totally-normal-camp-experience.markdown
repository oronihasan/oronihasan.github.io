![A Totally Normal Camp Experience](/assets/img_3984.png)

It was a stormy and dark night at the autumn camp we were at from Scouts. All seven people in our tent were bored out of their minds. And so I did something I hadn't done in a long time. I told one of my super duper amazing and fantastic stories. Of course EVERYONE was SUPER intrigued.
Eventually we all fell asleep though (because camps are tiring).

I woke excited as usual when one is at a camp but something felt off. Everything around me looked hazy or at least everything I could see in the winter morning darkness, but I just shrugged off as morning grogginess(or maybe everything looked hazy because I didn't have my iconic yellow glasses on).

I put my glasses on then I realized I was the only one left in the tent. No one was here neither was their stuff or sleeping bags. They had just disappeared without me. I went outside to look around and noticed two major differences:

1. the grass was white, like it was not simply covered by snow but white,
2. there were no other tents in sight. I turned around then noticed that our tent too, had just disappeared. Oh no.

I looked around once again and spotted something in the distance. I walked closer to it. It was a pink orb of light slightly larger than a basketball. The orb was slightly moving a few centimeters here to there to here again. I had read enough books to know that something exhilarating was going to happen now. Finally something in my very boring life would be exciting, scary,fun and probably nightmare inducing.

For a second I hesitated the logical part of me asking ‘Should we really be doing this? It feels wrong to mess with things you don’t know about. Would you like it if some random person messed with your magical glowing orb thingy maginy you worked hard to make?’ I shut that part of me up because I'm not missing the only chance in my life to do something thrilling. I grabbed the orb of pink light and immediately I felt a hot sharp pain going through my body. It was like every atom in my body was being pulled apart from each other then disappearing. Starting to think this is a bad idea I tried to let go of the orb (which by the way was not an orb of pink light but an orb of pink fire which was scorchingly hot) but I quickly became aware that MY ARMS WERE GONE!!! Before I could react to this unexpected occurrence everything became very very bright.

Once my eyes stopped burning from the abnormal light and I could see again I discovered that I was no longer in camp. I had teleported(I had always wanted to try that but I didn't think it would be this painful). At least I got my arms back though. I looked around but everything was misty so I couldn't see much. I was able to distinguish a stone that looked like an oval in the ground.

```txt
   - 'Wait' I said aloud 'to no one'.
   - ‘This is a tombstone. That means…’ I said again to no one, realizing that I was in a graveyard. Alone. Yay!
```

Now I'm not scared of graveyards (I think it’s just a peaceful place where dead human peoples can rest and can have nothing to worry about except how bacteria and bugs are eating their dead bodies. This is just what i think though) but it was what stood on one particular gravestone that scared me.

The gravestone read in big bold letters was my name, “Oroni Hasan, 13/09/2013 - 04/10/2025”. There were other gravestones too. To my horror they read the names of my closest friends: “Jhinuk Kenakate Kore 14/03/2013 - 04/10/2025” ,“Ebba Anderson 18/09/2013 - 04/10/2025” ,“Emily Campbell 03/05/2013- 04/10/2025” , “Isabella Ramírez-Arellano 03/03/2013 - 04/10/2025” “Sofia Green-King 05/09/2013 - 04/10/2025” ,”Amina Mutum 30/10/2013 - 04/10/2025” ,”Helios Fortis 24/07/2014 - 04/10/2025”. At that moment i thought to myself ‘Wow i have a looooooot of close friends’.

A second later it started storming, like in every other scary story. The rain was cold. I could feel every drop of water splash against me, the wind was annoyingly cold and strong, pushing me backwards. Now I could also hear thunder (I couldn't see the lighting because I couldn't open my eyes for it was too windy).

Suddenly I felt my back against something solid, but fluffy? Slowly I turned around (honestly it was much easier than I thought it would be, because the wind forcing me to look that way anyways). What I saw made my jaw drop. Towering in front of me was a ginormous and fluffy castel painted in bright pink and almost glowing-white(which very much hurt my eyes to look at).Somehow I went from a horror story to a fairy tail. I had and have no idea what a castel might be doing next to a graveyard but I was just glad to see shelter (bonus that the shelter was not a haunted mansion). I quickly found the entrance because it was four times my size, glowing and golden. Above the entrance stood something written in (international) morse code (Not to toot my own horn but I am totally excellent at morse code). It read: . . _ _ _    . _ _ _ _   _ _ _ _ .   _ . . . . , which translates to 2194. Just then a keypad lock appeared beside the entrance of the castel.

I typed in the code and immediately the floor beneath me opened and I fell. A bit too late I realized the code was 2196 not 2194!

I fell for what felt like hours and hours(it actually felt like 67.41 seconds but other people saw hours so I shall too!).I landed with a ‘oof’ on the bottom of the pit but luckily there was something softish below me. I checked to see what broke my fall only to realize I shouldn't have. It was human hair (I could tell it was human because I saw rotten heads and bodies below the hair. Plenty of bugs too.).

After I leaped out of the heap of bodies and almost threw up I noticed I was not alone. There was another girl just about 6.7 meters away from me. I walked closer to see her. She looked like a pretty average girly girl. She had blond hair and gray eyes and tons of makeup. She was wearing a pink tank-top and a matching pink skirt but they were pretty dirty and smelled like sweat and rotten flesh.

```txt
 - ‘Wh-where am I?’ I asked, very frightened.
 - ‘W-who are you?’ I added.
 - ‘AND WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE DEAD BODIES!?!?!?’ I screamed pretty loud, my voice echoing so I could tell we were in a pretty big area.
```

A few seconds after I asked, the girl dropped unconscious. I would like to say I heroically caught her and saved her life but well… I did however check if she was breathing which she luckily was. Before I could do anything else she gasped and stood up again but her neck was bent in an unnatural angle. She tried to adjust her head trying to make it look normal then - CRACK!- Her head popped clean off her body splattering what looked like milk - no not milk - it was white blood.

```txt
 - ‘Wh-what a-are you?’ I asked, taking a step backwards,(mostly to myself because how could a decapitated head answer any questions?) my voice quivering.
```

Then I heroically tripped on a decapitated and rotting arm, falling back into the heap of dead and rotting bodies. I tried to get back up but several arms and hair strands pulled me back into the pile again.
Her, sorry its’ eyes on its’ decapitated head was slowly tuning whiter and whiter and now as bright as a light bulb

```txt
 - ‘I…’ it announced without moving her mouth on her decapitated head.
 - ‘AM STEVEE’ it declared quite loudly (and this time moving its’ mouth) in Jack Black's voice.
```

Then it started singing "Chicken Lava” from “A NineCrap movie” (without moving its’ mouth), then I suddenly became a literal chicken then was cooked alive immediately by lava falling down on me and the pile of not so dead bodies, so I BECAME the chicken lava. It was not fun.

I jolted awake, heart pounding after hearing an eerie laughter off in the distance. I froze for a second, but then quickly realized I was safely tucked inside my sleeping bag. Most importantly my friends were also in the tent this time … at least I thought so, it was hard to see with the Swedish morning darkness. I reached for my glasses and turned on my phone flashlight to double-check. Yep. They were all there. Still breathing. Still human peoples.

```txt
 - ‘Guys, I had the scariest nightmare ever!’ I exclaimed while putting on my glasses, then told them about my nightmare while they were exchanging glances at each other.
 - ‘Weird, just before you woke up we were discussing how we all had that exact nightmare.’ replied Emily in an unexpectedly chill tone.
```

THE END… maybe?
